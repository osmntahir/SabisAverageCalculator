        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: September 24, 2025</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The Sabis Average Calculator ("the extension") is designed to calculate grade averages on the Sakarya University Information System (SABİS) pages. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data the extension accesses and how it is used.
        </p>

        <h2>Single Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            This extension has a single purpose: to read the grade table data (such as course names, credits, and grades) exclusively on <code>https://obs.sabis.sakarya.edu.tr/</code>, and then locally calculate and display the semester and overall grade point average within the user's browser.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Collected and Used</h2>
        <p>
            To perform its function, the extension accesses data classified as "Website Content." This data includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Course information, credit values, and grades from the SABİS transcript page at <code>https://obs.sabis.sakarya.edu.tr/</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This data is used <strong>exclusively</strong> for real-time grade average calculation and is <strong>never</strong> saved, stored, transmitted to servers, or shared with any third parties. All calculations happen locally within your browser and the data is only processed momentarily.
        </p>

        <h2>Extension Settings Storage</h2>
        <p>
            The extension uses Chrome's built-in storage API to remember only one simple setting: whether the extension is enabled or disabled (on/off). This setting:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contains <strong>no personal information whatsoever</strong></li>
            <li>Is stored securely using Chrome's official storage system</li>
            <li>Can sync across your Chrome browsers when signed in (optional Chrome feature)</li>
            <li>Can be deleted by uninstalling the extension</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Justification for Minimal Permissions</h2>
        <p>This extension requests only the minimal permissions necessary for its single purpose:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong><code>storage</code> Permission:</strong> Required to save your on/off preference for the extension. This uses Chrome's secure storage system and contains no personal data - only a simple boolean value (true/false) indicating if the extension should be active.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Content Scripts on <code>https://obs.sabis.sakarya.edu.tr/*</code>:</strong> The extension operates exclusively on SABİS pages to read grade tables and display calculated averages. It cannot and does not access any other websites or data.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> We deliberately avoided requesting permissions like <code>activeTab</code>, <code>scripting</code>, or broad host permissions to minimize privacy impact and ensure Google Chrome Web Store approval.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Sharing and Security</h2>
        <p>
            User data (including website content) is not sold, transferred, or used for any purpose other than the approved single purpose (grade calculation). Your data belongs to you and remains within your browser.
        </p>
