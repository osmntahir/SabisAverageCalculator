        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The Sabis Average Calculator ("the extension") is designed to calculate grade averages on the Sakarya University Information System (SABİS) pages. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data the extension accesses and how it is used.
        </p>

        <h2>Single Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            This extension has a single purpose: to read the grade table data (such as course names, credits, and grades) exclusively on <code>https://obs.sabis.sakarya.edu.tr/</code>, and then locally calculate and display the semester and overall grade point average within the user's browser.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Collected and Used</h2>
        <p>
            To perform its function, the extension accesses data classified as "Website Content." This data includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Course information, credit values, and grades from the SABİS transcript page.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This data is used momentarily for the sole purpose of calculation and is <strong>absolutely not</strong> saved, stored, sent to our servers, or shared with any third parties. All calculations happen locally on your browser.
        </p>

        <h2>Justification for Permissions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Host (<code>https://obs.sabis.sakarya.edu.tr/*</code>) and <code>scripting</code> Permissions:</strong> These permissions are mandatory for the extension to operate on the specified SABİS page, read the grade table, and display the calculated average. The extension does not run or read data on any other website.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><code>storage</code> Permission:</strong> This is used to save the user's preference for the extension's state ("on" or "off") in your browser's local storage. No personal data is stored here.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><code>activeTab</code> Permission:</strong> This permission allows the extension to gain temporary access to the active tab when the user clicks the extension's icon. This is a secure method that is only triggered by user interaction.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Sharing and Security</h2>
        <p>
            User data (including website content) is not sold, transferred, or used for any purpose other than the approved single purpose (grade calculation). Your data belongs to you and remains within your browser.
        </p>
